### 📊 Comprehensive Logging System

Oxidized provides extensive logging capabilities for development, debugging, and performance monitoring:

#### **Log Levels and Usage**

**Available Log Levels** (in order of verbosity):

- `error` - Critical errors only
- `warn` - Warnings and errors
- `info` - General information, warnings, and errors
- `debug` - Detailed debugging information (**default for debug builds**)
- `trace` - Ultra-verbose tracing (development only)

> **Note**: Debug builds automatically enable `debug` level logging without requiring `RUST_LOG` to be set. Release builds respect the `RUST_LOG` environment variable and default to `info` level.

#### **Environment Variables**

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell - Set logging level
$env:RUST_LOG="debug"                    # Debug level for all modules
$env:RUST_LOG="oxidized=trace"           # Trace level for oxidized only
$env:RUST_LOG="oxidized::editor=debug"   # Debug level for editor module only

# Multiple modules with different levels
$env:RUST_LOG="oxidized::buffer=trace,oxidized::syntax=debug,warn"

# Run with custom logging
cargo run filename.txt
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS - Set logging level
export RUST_LOG=debug                    # Debug level for all modules
export RUST_LOG=oxidized=trace           # Trace level for oxidized only
export RUST_LOG=oxidized::editor=debug   # Debug level for editor module only

# Multiple modules with different levels
export RUST_LOG="oxidized::buffer=trace,oxidized::syntax=debug,warn"

# Run with custom logging
cargo run filename.txt
```

#### **Log File Management**

**Automatic Logging:**

- Debug builds: Automatic `debug` level logging to `oxidized.log` (enabled by default)
- Release builds: `info` level logging (configurable via `RUST_LOG`)
- Log rotation: Logs are appended, manual cleanup recommended

**Real-time Log Monitoring:**

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell - Monitor logs in real-time
Get-Content oxidized.log -Wait -Tail 50

# Filter specific log levels
Get-Content oxidized.log -Wait | Select-String "ERROR|WARN"

# Watch specific modules
Get-Content oxidized.log -Wait | Select-String "editor|buffer"
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS - Monitor logs in real-time  
tail -f oxidized.log

# Filter specific log levels
tail -f oxidized.log | grep -E "(ERROR|WARN)"

# Watch specific modules
tail -f oxidized.log | grep -E "(editor|buffer)"
```

#### **Module-Specific Logging**

Key modules you can monitor individually:

```bash
# Core editing functionality
RUST_LOG=oxidized::editor=trace

# Buffer operations and text manipulation
RUST_LOG=oxidized::buffer=debug

# Syntax highlighting and Tree-sitter
RUST_LOG=oxidized::syntax=debug

# Configuration system and file watching
RUST_LOG=oxidized::config=info

# Search engine and regex operations
RUST_LOG=oxidized::search=debug

# Theme system and color management
RUST_LOG=oxidized::theme=info

# Macro recording and playback
RUST_LOG=oxidized::features::macros=trace
```

#### **Performance Debugging**

```bash
# Monitor performance with timing logs
RUST_LOG="oxidized::ui=debug,oxidized::buffer=debug" cargo run large_file.txt

# Trace syntax highlighting performance
RUST_LOG=oxidized::syntax=trace cargo run code_file.rs

# Debug memory usage and allocations
RUST_LOG=trace cargo run --features debug-allocations
```

**Issue**: `oxy` command not found or permission denied

**Solutions:**

```powershell
# Windows - Check PATH and permissions
where oxy                                    # Verify installation location
$env:PATH += ";C:\path\to\oxidized\target\release"  # Add to PATH if needed

# If building from source
cargo build --release
.\target\release\oxy.exe filename.txt       # Run directly
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS - Check PATH and permissions
which oxy                                    # Verify installation location
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/oxidized/target/release"  # Add to PATH if needed

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod +x ./target/release/oxy
./target/release/oxy filename.txt           # Run directly
```

#### **Configuration Not Loading**

**Issue**: Custom settings in TOML files are ignored

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Verify file locations:**

   ```bash
   # Configuration files should be in current directory or ~/.config/oxidized/
   ls -la *.toml                            # Linux/macOS
   Get-ChildItem *.toml                     # Windows
   ```

2. **Check TOML syntax:**

   ```powershell
   # Windows - Enable detailed config logging
   $env:RUST_LOG="oxidized::config=trace"
   cargo run filename.txt
   Get-Content oxidized.log | Select-String "config"
   ```

3. **Reset to defaults:**

   ```bash
   # Backup and reset configuration
   mv editor.toml editor.toml.backup
   mv keymaps.toml keymaps.toml.backup  
   mv themes.toml themes.toml.backup
   cargo run                               # Will recreate defaults
   ```

#### **Performance Issues**

**Issue**: Slow response times or high memory usage

**Diagnostic Commands:**

```bash
# Monitor performance with detailed logging
RUST_LOG="oxidized::ui=debug,oxidized::buffer=debug" cargo run large_file.txt

# Check for syntax highlighting bottlenecks
RUST_LOG=oxidized::syntax=trace cargo run source_code.rs
```

**Performance Solutions:**

1. **Disable syntax highlighting temporarily:**

   ```toml
   # In editor.toml
   [syntax]
   enabled = false
   ```

2. **Reduce background processing:**

   ```toml
   # In editor.toml
   [performance]
   async_processing = false
   max_syntax_workers = 1
   ```

3. **Monitor system resources:**

   ```powershell
   # Windows - Monitor while running
   Get-Process -Name "oxy" | Format-Table CPU,PM,VM -AutoSize
   ```

#### **Terminal Display Issues**

**Issue**: Corrupted display, missing characters, or color problems

**Solutions:**

1. **Terminal Compatibility:**

   ```powershell
   # Windows - Use Windows Terminal for best results
   winget install Microsoft.WindowsTerminal
   
   # Set proper terminal environment
   $env:TERM="xterm-256color"
   ```

2. **Unicode Issues:**

   ```bash
   # Ensure proper locale settings
   export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
   ```

3. **Color Support:**

   ```bash
   # Test terminal color support
   curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/HaleTom/89ffe32783f89f403bba96bd7bcd1263/raw/ | bash
   ```

#### **File Access Problems**

**Issue**: Cannot read/write files, permission errors

**Solutions:**

```powershell
# Windows - Check file permissions and ownership
Get-Acl filename.txt
icacls filename.txt                          # View detailed permissions

# Run with elevated permissions if needed
Start-Process "cargo run filename.txt" -Verb RunAs
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS - Check and fix permissions
ls -la filename.txt                          # Check current permissions
chmod 644 filename.txt                       # Fix read/write permissions
sudo chown $USER:$USER filename.txt         # Fix ownership if needed
```

#### **Macro Recording Issues**

**Issue**: Macros not recording or playing back correctly

**Debugging:**

```bash
# Enable detailed macro logging
RUST_LOG="oxidized::features::macros=trace" cargo run

# Common issues and solutions:
# 1. Recording already in progress - press 'q' to stop current recording
# 2. Invalid register name - use a-z, A-Z, or 0-9
# 3. Empty macro - ensure you performed actions during recording
```
