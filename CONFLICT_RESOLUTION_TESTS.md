# Node Conflict Resolution Regression Tests

This document describes the comprehensive regression tests added to prevent future issues with syntax highlighting node conflict resolution.

## Background

The syntax highlighting system uses tree-sitter to parse code and extract nodes for highlighting. However, tree-sitter can produce overlapping nodes for the same text span, leading to conflicts about which color to apply. Our conflict resolution system uses a priority-based approach to resolve these conflicts.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Async Race Conditions**: Multiple async highlighting requests were polluting the cache with partial results
2. **Node Priority Bugs**: Equal-priority nodes were being dropped instead of coexisting
3. **Missing Node Types**: Some important syntax elements (like colons) weren't being highlighted

## Test Suite Overview

### 1. `test_node_conflict_resolution`

- **Purpose**: Tests basic field_identifier vs identifier conflict resolution
- **Key Test**: Ensures field names like `x` in `struct Point { x: f64 }` get `field_identifier` priority over generic `identifier`
- **Regression Prevention**: Prevents field names from losing their green highlighting

### 2. `test_node_priority_system`

- **Purpose**: Validates all priority assignments are correct
- **Coverage**: Tests all 20+ node types with their expected priority values
- **Key Priorities**:
  - `field_identifier`: 10 (highest)
  - `primitive_type`: 7 (higher than containers)
  - punctuation (`:`, `{`, `}`): 6 (higher than containers)
  - containers (`field_declaration_list`): 3 (lower than specific nodes)
  - `identifier`: 1 (lowest)

### 3. `test_overlapping_node_resolution`

- **Purpose**: Tests real-world overlapping node scenarios
- **Coverage**: Struct with multiple fields and types
- **Validation**: Ensures high-priority nodes win conflicts without losing important lower-priority nodes

### 4. `test_complex_struct_conflict_resolution`

- **Purpose**: End-to-end test of the exact problematic case that was fixed
- **Test Data**: Multi-struct file with various field types (f64, bool, u32, String)
- **Critical Elements Tested**:
  - struct keyword (red)
  - field names (green)
  - primitive types (blue)
  - type identifiers (orange)
  - punctuation (orange)
- **Regression Check**: Ensures we have â‰¥20 highlights vs the previous 17

### 5. `test_punctuation_priority_over_containers`

- **Purpose**: Tests that punctuation tokens get priority over container nodes
- **Specific Case**: Closing brace `}` should be punctuation, not part of `field_declaration_list`
- **Validation**: Prevents container nodes from "swallowing" specific punctuation highlighting

### 6. `test_no_valid_nodes_dropped_during_resolution`

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive regression test ensuring no essential syntax elements are lost
- **Coverage**: Tests all critical elements exist after conflict resolution
- **Elements Checked**: struct, field names, types, punctuation with correct colors
- **Safety Net**: Catches any future changes that might accidentally drop valid nodes

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Priority System**: Clear hierarchy prevents ambiguous conflicts
2. **Theme Completeness**: Added missing `:` colon mapping to theme
3. **Conflict Resolution Algorithm**: Fixed logic that was dropping equal-priority nodes
4. **Race Condition Fixes**: Eliminated async cache pollution issues
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: 600+ lines of regression tests covering all edge cases

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all conflict resolution tests
cargo test resolution -- --quiet

# Run priority system tests  
cargo test priority -- --quiet

# Run comprehensive suite
cargo test -- --quiet
```

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes, struct syntax highlighting should consistently show:

- `struct` keyword in red (#ff7b72)
- Field names in green (#7ee787)
- Primitive types in blue (#79c0ff)
- Type identifiers in orange (#f0883e)
- Punctuation in orange (#f0883e)
- All 23 expected highlights present (vs previous 17)

## Future Maintenance

These tests serve as regression guards. Any future changes to:

- Node priority assignments
- Conflict resolution algorithm
- Theme mappings
- Tree-sitter integration

Should be validated against this test suite to ensure syntax highlighting remains consistent and complete.
