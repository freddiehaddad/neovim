## Current Architecture Assessment

The current implementation has a solid foundation:

- ✅ **Mode system**: Well implemented with proper state transitions
- ✅ **Key mapping**: Flexible TOML-based configuration
- ✅ **Action system**: Clean separation between key handling and actions
- ✅ **Text objects**: Comprehensive implementation
- ✅ **Operator system**: Proper operator-pending mode

This architecture makes it relatively straightforward to add missing features by:

1. Adding new action methods to the KeymapConfig impl
2. Adding corresponding entries to the execute_action match statement
3. Updating the keymaps.toml file with new bindings

The most complex features to implement will be:

- **Repeat system** (`.`): Requires command recording and replay
- **Register system**: Needs clipboard integration and storage
- **Macros**: Builds on the repeat system
- **Folding**: Requires text analysis and display changes
